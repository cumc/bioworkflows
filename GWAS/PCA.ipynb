    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to generate a PCA include \n",
    "\n",
    "- removing related individuals\n",
    "- pruning variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD)\n",
    "- perform PCA analysis on genotype\n",
    "- excluding outlier samples in the PCA space for individuals of homogeneous self-reported ancestry. These outliers may suggest poor genotyping quality or distant relatedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the PCs may capture LD structure rather than population structure (decrease in power to detect associations in these regions of high LD)\n",
    "2. When projecting a new study dataset to the PCA space computed from a reference dataset: projected PCs are shrunk toward 0 in the new dataset\n",
    "3. PC scores may capture outliers that are due to family structure, population structure or other reasons; it might be beneficial to detect and remove these individuals to maximize the population structure captured by PCA (in the case of removing a few outliers) or to restrict analyses to genetically homogeneous samples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Genotype in PLINK format: could be different from bfile in the case of using for e.g. exome data / imputed genotype data\n",
    "2. Phentype files with population information and possibly disease or other labelling information\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs should be splitted into sets of related and unrelated individuals. Additionally you may want to prepare data per population. See \"How to run this workflow\" section for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",

    "## General workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate relatedness of the individuals in the sample by PLINK 2 that implements the KING algorithm\n",
    "2. Select specific SNPs and samples using PLINK (QC maf>1%, geno missing rate (`geno`) 0.1, individual missing rate (`mind`) =0.1 and `hwe`=5e-08), and remove related individuals\n",
    "3. SNPs thining by doing LD-pruning (window=50, shift=10, r2=0.1 are the defaults)\n",
    "4. Run PCA using only unrelated individuals for all populations, and examine the resulting plot\n",
    "5. Project back related individuals, and generate a list of suggested samples to remove based on Mahalanobis distance test statistic per population. Default criteria is 0.997 percentile (two sided) but we recommend checking the output plot before and after removal and rethink about it.\n",
    "6. Remove outliers based on list previously generated\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the data should not have outliers. If you have subpopulations in the data, then additional steps should be applied for:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Split data into different populations, each population data should have both related vs unrelated individual data-sets\n",
    "8. For each population, perform QC\n",

    "10. For each population, project related samples back to the PC space\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick recap of PCA analysis for those not immediately familiar with the method. PCA is a mathematical method to reduce dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. \n",
    "This is accomplished by identifying directions or Principal Components (PC's) that account for the maximum variation in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to PCA is based on the singular-value decomposition of the the data matrix $X$ (in our case the genotype matrix),\n",
    "$$X = U D V^T,$$\n",
    "where $U$ are the left eigenvectors, $D$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values, and $V$ are the right eigenvectors (also called loadings). \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA can also be done using the eigen-decomposition of $X X^T$\n",
    "$$X X^T = U S U^T,$$ where $S=D^2$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\n",
    "$X$ is usually centred (mean-subtracted) or standardised (mean subtracted, then divided by standard deviation) before PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "For PCA of SNP genotypes (at least in diploid organisms), the common standardisation is\n",
    "$$X_{ij}^{\\prime} = \\frac{X_{ij} - 2p_j}{\\sqrt{2 p_j (1 - p_j)}},$$\n",
    "where $X_{ij}$ is the genotype (minor allele dosage $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$) for the $i$th individual and the $j$th SNP, and $p_j$ is the minor allele frequency (MAF) for the $j$th SNP. In addition, the eigenvalues are scaled by the number of SNPs $m$ (equivalent to performing the eigen-decomposition of $XX^T/m$).\n"
