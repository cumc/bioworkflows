    "1. Genomic coordinate can be zero- or one-based. That means SNP positions can start from **start from 0**, instead of 1. This is indeed the case for 1000 Genomes data. In order to be consistent with one-based summary statistics, we need to **add 1** to all 1000 genome SNPs position.\n",
    "2. Reference and alternative alleles may mismatch between summary statistics and the reference panel. If it is a simple ref / alt flip we need to also flip the coding of genotypes or sign of summary statistics to adjust for the effect size direction. If it is strand flip we need to convert summary statistics and genotype data to use the same strand first and take from there. \n",
    "3. When strand flip is involved, cases such as A/T and C/G are no longer identifiable -- whether it be strand flip or ref / alt flip. We will have to remove these locus (having A/T or C/G genotypes) from analysis."

    "    - Not identical, `A/T`, `T/A`, `G/C` or `C/G` for `ref/alt`: consider this situation at last; if flip strand has applied in this LD block, then flip strand and keep the sign of z score and beta; if not, switch ref and alt of $S_2$, add opposite sign for z score and beta.\n",
